153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

想法：其实题目就是让你找到反转的地方。因为还sorted,用二分法.
找到中间，如果中间<第一个数，那么反转点在左边，如果中间>第一个数，那么反转点在右边。


``` java
public int findMin(int[] nums) {
    int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (nums[m] <= nums[r]) {
            r = m;
        } else {
            l = m + 1;
        }
    }
    return nums[l];
}
```
